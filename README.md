# A Python3 script which can embed lyrics to MP3 files. Before using, make sure client id and client secret are set properly in the source code.
# One way to go about this would be to make a client of your own in the Genius API, since my client secret won't be public. 

# This code will be able to add lyrics to MP3 files in a given folder that is in the same directory as the script.
